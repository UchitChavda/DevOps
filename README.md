here at the initial stage we have all the data items in a single cluster.
In the next step , we have randomly seperated the data items in two clusters named cluster 1 and cluster 2.
After seperating the data items into clusters , we will find out the mean of the data items for each cluster.
According to the mean we will rearrange the data items in the two clusters considering mean as the center of the cluster.

We will keep on repeating the above step until we get the values of means of two clusters same for two consecutive iterations.
Same value of means in two consecutive iterations indicates that we have correctly classified our data items into clusters.

This is how the k-mean clustering algorithm works
